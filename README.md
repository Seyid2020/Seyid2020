- 👋 Hi, I’m Ebnou Abdem seyid Abdellahi 
- I am looking to pursue a postdoctoral position in the field of Statistics or Machine Learning.
- 👀 I’m interested in Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI, and Applied  Mathematics.
- 🌱 I have completed my PhD in Statistics and am currently a part-time teacher at Mohamed V University in Rabat..
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on projects related to Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI, and Applied Mathematics.
- My favorite research topic is the intersection of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), Multiblocks, and Machine Learning, which can be seen in the field of Predictive Structural Equation Modeling (PSEM). PSEM combines the strengths of SEM, multiblocks, and machine learning techniques to develop predictive models that can be used for data-driven decision-making.
