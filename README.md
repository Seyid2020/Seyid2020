- ðŸ‘‹ Hi
I am Dr. Seyid Ebnou, a statistician and data scientist, currently serving as a postdoctoral researcher at the Center of Urban Systems (CUS) at Mohamed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) in Ben Guerir, Morocco. Additionally, I held the position of Associate Professor at Mohammed V University in Rabat from 2020 to 2023, where I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics in July 2023.

Throughout my career, I have actively participated in the scientific committees of numerous international conferences, earned various professional certificates, and authored numerous research papers.

My research interests encompass statistics, machine learning, urban systems, smart cities, and data science. I am deeply passionate about leveraging sophisticated statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to address complex challenges related to our environment and sustainability. With a robust background in statistics and applied mathematics, I am committed to advancing knowledge in this dynamic field.

My expertise in Statistics enables me to effectively model complex phenomena and employ advanced Machine Learning and statistical modeling techniques to extract valuable insights from intricate datasets. 

 
- My favorite research topic is the intersection of structural equation modeling (SEM), multiblocks, and machine Learning, which can be seen in the field of Predictive Structural Equation Modeling (PSEM). PSEM combines the strengths of SEM, multi blocks, and machine learning techniques to develop predictive models that can be used for data-driven decision-making.
